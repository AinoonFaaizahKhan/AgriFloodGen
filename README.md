ðŸŒ¾ AgriFloodGen: IoT-Based Smart Flood Detection System

AgriFloodGen is an IoT-enabled flood monitoring and alert system designed to assist farmers in preventing crop damage due to floods. The system integrates multiple sensors â€” an ultrasonic sensor for water level, soil moisture sensors, and a DHT22 sensor for temperature and humidity â€” all connected to an ESP32 microcontroller.

Sensor data is transmitted to the ThingSpeak cloud for real-time analysis, while a receiver ESP32 retrieves the processed data and displays flood risk levels using an LCD display and LED indicators. The system applies a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to optimize sensor weightage for more accurate flood prediction.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

Real-time monitoring of rainfall, soil moisture, and weather conditions

Cloud-based data transmission using ThingSpeak

Visual flood alerts through LEDs and LCD display

GA-optimized decision logic for accurate risk assessment

Supports sustainable and data-driven agriculture

ðŸšœ Purpose:
To empower farmers with early flood warnings and real-time environmental insights, helping them protect crops and improve resilience against natural disasters.
